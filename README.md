# Obsidian + gruvbox alternative

This is my take on the [Obsidian gruvbox style by insanum](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_gruvbox). I wanted larger fonts and more contrast (you can guess why), but ended up making small cosmetic changes. The graph view is the default one. List of changes [here](#changes).
